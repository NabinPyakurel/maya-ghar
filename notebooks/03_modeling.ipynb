The R² score of 0.008 means that only about 0.8% of the variation in FDI can be explained by Political Stability according to this model. The RMSE of 38.978 suggests that, on average, the model's predictions for FDI are off by about 39 percentage points of GDP. The coefficient of 7.483 implies that for every one-unit increase in Political Stability, FDI is predicted to increase by about 7.48 percentage points, with an intercept of 8.860 (predicted FDI when stability is zero).\n",

        "*   **Practical Implication:** This suggests that while political stability is a favorable factor for businesses considering foreign investment, it is far from the only or most important factor. Investors likely consider a wide range of other economic, market, and regulatory factors much more heavily when making investment decisions.\n",
